Guide to make changes if ur using terminal without source control 
1) Clone the github repository 
git clone https://github.com/Jwongjs/Data-Visualization-Project
cd myproject

2) Create and Activate the Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv

*Good practive to activate once folder is opened
Windows (Command Prompt):

macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

3) Push changes (update development of codes)
    i) Activate virtual Environment
    ii) Check status of repository (see which files are changed)
        git status
    iii) Add changed files to staging 
        To add all changed files : git add .
        To add a specific file: git add filename.py
    iv) Commit the changes  
        git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message" (explain what changes are made)
    v) Push changes to the remote repository
        git push origin master

*Handling merge conflicts
If someone else has pushed changes to the remote repository while you were working, you might encounter merge conflicts. 
Hereâ€™s how to handle them:

1) Pull the Latest Changes:
git pull origin master

2) Resolve Any Conflicts:
Git will highlight the conflicting files. Open these files, manually resolve the conflicts, and then stage the resolved files.
git add resolved_file.py

3) Commit the Resolved Changes:
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

4) Push the Changes:
git push origin master
